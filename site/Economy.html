				<header>Basic Overview</header>
				<br/>
				<p>
					Welcome to FBot's economy! This will be your guide to FBot's economy system.
					Firstly the big question, how do you earn money? To earn money, or FBux,
					indicated by this symbol: ' <b><del>f</del></b> ', you must work.
					<br/><br/>
					Working is fairly straight forward, every hour you can take a work shift and
					earn your jobs worth of money (minus tax). Now I bet that sounds pretty neat,
					but with FBot's multi trillion dollar maintenance costs, we have to keep tax
					high, so tax can be anywhere between 60% and 90%, depending on how lucky you
					are. And just so you don't have to worry, tax comes straight off your paycheck,
					how thoughtful! You'll never have to worry about forgetting to pay it again!
					<br/><br/>
					Now we have a wide selection of jobs, but you can't just apply for any one of
					them - you're not qualified! Silly you, you need to take a degree first. Degrees
					you say? Well glad you asked, see you can take a degree which will allow you to
					apply for a certain job. Easy? Not so fast. You won't be able to study any old
					degree, majority of degrees start of as locked but you will gain access to more
					and more of them as you interact with FBot. Done? Not quite. As you study for
					your degree, which operates similarly to the work function, you will accumulate
					debt, why? Who knows! To think you're only studying to pay more taxes in the
					future.
				</p>
				<header>Working and Studying</header>
				<br/>
				<p>
					To work and study use FBot work and FBot study. But wait... There's more.
					To find jobs and degrees, you can use <mark>FBot degrees</mark> and <mark>FBot
					jobs</mark>. Now this is just mind blowing, BUT THERE'S MORE! You can't just
					study without a degree, so to take a degree or apply for a job use <mark>FBot
					apply &ltjob&gt</mark> or <mark>FBot take &ltdegree&gt</mark>. Bet you weren't
					expecting that. One final point. If you have a job and want to pick a new one,
					or if your degree really isn't to your liking, you can drop it no questions asked.
					So that's <mark>FBot resign</mark> for jobs, and <mark>FBot drop</mark> for
					degrees. Make sure you know what you're doing, because you won't be able to
					recover your progress for degrees. There, now I'm done.
				</p>
				<header>Multipliers</header>
				<br/>
				<p>
					Doesn't practise make perfect? Yes. Same applies for FBot, the more you spam,
					the more your multipliers increase, the relevant ones at least. There are three
					types of multipliers, first is your personal one. This multiplier follows you
					everywhere. Every time you interact with FBot, even in DMs, this multiplier will
					increase. Second is your server multiplier. This will increase as people
					interact with FBot in a server, the more a server uses FBot, the higher the
					multiplier increases by. Last there is your job multiplier. This is specific to
					each job and increases every time you successfully work. Multipliers are used
					to increase the amount of money you earn. Your personal multiplier can also
					help you unlock new degree which in turn gives you access to new jobs.
				</p>
				<header>Information</header>
				<br/>
				<p>
					Wanna see your progress as a FBoter? Use <mark>FBot profile</mark>. Wanna laugh at
					inferior mortals? Use <mark>FBot profile @inferior mortal</mark>. Wanna view your
					multipliers? Use <mark>FBot mutlis</mark>. Want me to stop? No? That's what I
					thought. You can use <mark>FBot cmds</mark> to view a full list of available
					commands.
				</p>
				<header>Competitive, Store, Suggestions and More!</header>
				<br/><br><br>
				<p>
					It's no fun winning and not knowing it, know it. Use <mark>FBot top bal</mark> to
					view the richest FBoters and <mark>FBot top debt</mark> to view the most in debt.
					Other tops include: <mark>netbal</mark>, <mark>netdebt</mark>, <mark>multi</mark>
					and <mark>servmulti</mark>
					<br/><br/>
					Use your money, to get... more money. Learn how to commit tax evasion or money
					laundering, or whatever else we choose to add! What better way to invest your
					hard earned cash, than in more cash and future content!
					<br/><br/>
					We're always working on new ways to improve FBot, if you have any suggestions,
					or just wanna drop by for a chat, follow the link above to join our server.
					<br/><br/>
					Currently there is no way to remove debt, but since it doesn't cause you any
					harm, you'll just have to learn to live with it - for now.
